## SC-45: System Time Synchronization
Synchronize system clocks within and between systems and system components.

**Guidance:** Time synchronization of system clocks is essential for the correct execution of many system services, including identification and authentication processes that involve certificates and time-of-day restrictions as part of access control. Denial of service or failure to deny expired credentials may r

## SC-46: Cross Domain Policy Enforcement
Implement a policy enforcement mechanism {{ insert: param, sc-46_odp }} between the physical and/or network interfaces for the connecting security domains.

**Guidance:** For logical policy enforcement mechanisms, organizations avoid creating a logical path between interfaces to prevent the ability to bypass the policy enforcement mechanism. For physical policy enforcement mechanisms, the robustness of physical isolation afforded by the physical implementation of pol

## SC-47: Alternate Communications Paths
Establish {{ insert: param, sc-47_odp }} for system operations organizational command and control.

**Guidance:** An incident, whether adversarial- or nonadversarial-based, can disrupt established communications paths used for system operations and organizational command and control. Alternate communications paths reduce the risk of all communications paths being affected by the same incident. To compound the p

**Related:** CP-2, CP-8

## SC-48: Sensor Relocation
Relocate {{ insert: param, sc-48_odp.01 }} to {{ insert: param, sc-48_odp.02 }} under the following conditions or circumstances: {{ insert: param, sc-48_odp.03 }}.

**Guidance:** Adversaries may take various paths and use different approaches as they move laterally through an organization (including its systems) to reach their target or as they attempt to exfiltrate information from the organization. The organization often only has a limited set of monitoring and detection c

## SC-49: Hardware-enforced Separation and Policy Enforcement
Implement hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms between {{ insert: param, sc-49_odp }}.

**Guidance:** System owners may require additional strength of mechanism and robustness to ensure domain separation and policy enforcement for specific types of threats and environments of operation. Hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement provide greater strength of mechanism than software-enforced s

**Related:** AC-4, SA-8, SC-50

## SC-50: Software-enforced Separation and Policy Enforcement
Implement software-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms between {{ insert: param, sc-50_odp }}.

**Guidance:** System owners may require additional strength of mechanism to ensure domain separation and policy enforcement for specific types of threats and environments of operation.

**Related:** AC-3, AC-4, SA-8, SC-2, SC-3, SC-49

## SC-51: Hardware-based Protection
(sc-51_smt.a) Employ hardware-based, write-protect for {{ insert: param, sc-51_odp.01 }} ; and
  (sc-51_smt.b) Implement specific procedures for {{ insert: param, sc-51_odp.02 }} to manually disable hardware write-protect for firmware modifications and re-enable the write-protect prior to returning to operational mode.

**Guidance:** None.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- sc-51_obj.a hardware-based write-protect for {{ insert: param, sc-51_odp.01 }} is employed;
- sc-51_obj.b

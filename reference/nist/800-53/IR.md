  (ir-6_smt.b) Report incident information to {{ insert: param, ir-06_odp.02 }}.

**Guidance:** The types of incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Incident information can inform risk assessments, control effectiveness assess

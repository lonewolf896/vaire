  (ma-2_smt.c) Require that {{ insert: param, ma-02_odp.01 }} explicitly approve the removal of 

**Guidance:** Controlling system maintenance addresses the information security aspects of the system maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to system components conducted by local or nonlocal entities. Maintenance includes peripherals such as scanners, copiers, and printers. Information nece

- ma-2_obj.c {{ insert: param, ma-02_odp.01 }} is/are required to explicitly approve the removal of the system or system components from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance, repair, or replacement;
- ma-2_obj.d equipment is sanitized to remove {{ insert: param, ma-02_odp.02 }} from associated media prior to removal from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance, repair, or replacement;
- ma-2_obj.e all potentially impacted controls are checked to verify that the controls are still functioning properly following maintenance, repair, or replacement actions;
- ma-2_obj.f {{ insert: param, ma-02_odp.03 }} is included in organizational maintenance records.

## MA-3: Maintenance Tools
(ma-3_smt.a) Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools; and
  (ma-3_smt.b) Review previously approved system maintenance tools {{ insert: param, ma-03_odp }}.

**Guidance:** Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related issues associated with maintenance tools that are not within system authorization boundaries and are used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational systems. Organizations have flexibil

**Related:** MA-2, PE-16

**Assessment Objectives:**
- ma-3_obj.a 
- ma-3_obj.b previously approved system maintenance tools are reviewed {{ insert: param, ma-03_odp }}.

## MA-4: Nonlocal Maintenance
(ma-4_smt.a) Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;
  (ma-4_smt.b) Allow the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the system;
  (ma-4_smt.c) Employ strong authentication in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;
  (ma-4_smt.d) Maintain records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
  (ma-4_smt.e) Terminate session and network 

**Guidance:** Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who communicate through either an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating across a netw

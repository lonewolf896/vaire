## PL-4: Rules of Behavior
(pl-4_smt.a) Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior for information and system usage, security, and privacy;
  (pl-4_smt.b) Receive a documented acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and the system;
  (pl-4_smt.c) Review and update the rules of behavior {{ insert: param,

**Guidance:** Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for organizational users. Other types of access agreements include nondisclosure agreements, conflict-of-interest agreements, and acceptable use agreements (see [PS-6](#ps-6) ). Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user r

**Assessment Objectives:**
- pl-4_obj.a 
- pl-4_obj.b before authorizing access to information and the system, a documented acknowledgement from such individuals indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior is received;
- pl-4_obj.c rules of behavior are reviewed and updated {{ insert: param, pl-04_odp.01 }};
- pl-4_obj.d individuals who have acknowledged a previous version of the rules of behavior are required to read and reacknowledge {{ insert: param, pl-04_odp.02 }}.

## PL-7: Concept of Operations
(pl-7_smt.a) Develop a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the system describing how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security and privacy; and
  (pl-7_smt.b) Review and update the CONOPS {{ insert: param, pl-07_odp }}.

**Guidance:** The CONOPS may be included in the security or privacy plans for the system or in other system development life cycle documents. The CONOPS is a living document that requires updating throughout the system development life cycle. For example, during system design reviews, the concept of operations is

**Related:** PL-2, SA-2, SI-12

**Assessment Objectives:**
- pl-7_obj.a a CONOPS for the system describing how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security and privacy is developed;
